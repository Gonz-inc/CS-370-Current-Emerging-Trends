# CS-370 Current/Emerging Trends

## Description
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate what I have learned from the CS-370 course. In this course, I was introduced to common AI training models and how they work. The AI model example is based on a Qmaze example where an agent is learning how to navigate a maze as fast as possible. In my example, I was tasked to use deep Q Learning to create an agent that would solve the maze as fast as possible for a client for a video game company. The code was provided except for a portion of the algorithm for deep Q learning and some variables. I had to finish the file for it to work, which meant I had to complete the deep Q learning algorithm and its variables.

## Importance of Computer Science in AI Development
Computer scientists find solutions for problems that could be solved by software or computer-based mathematics to create logic that mimics a neural network, both in the hardware and software. This is very important as they will need to apply what they learned to find and improve solutions for AI models. An example would be how computer scientists use both mathematics and psychology into a program to get closer to building a system similar to that of a human. This is done by using modern models such as critic-actor, Reinforcement Learning, or Neural Network models.

## Problem Solving Approach
To approach a problem as a computer scientist, you would need to adopt an engineer’s mindset. Then, after studying the problem, you can apply practices found from your research and applying it in the programming or code, to create a system that performs a task in a logical order.

## Ethical Responsibilities
The ethical responsibility that a developer has is to make a product that won’t be designed for lead to harm of an individual both directly and indirectly. Protecting user’s data and incorporating a good data set to include diverse examples is also necessary when training the model. For the organization, it would need to make sure it is compliant with ethical standards and also ensure that the user’s data is handled correctly and is protected from exterior requests.
